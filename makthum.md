I am a Software Developer, Gadget Freak, technophile and yes I love playing PC games. I hold Masters degree from University of British Columbia in Electrical and Computer engineering. Currently based out in Vancouver, originally from Chennai, India. Steam claims that I have spent more than 1600 hours playing Dota 2 in last couple of years. Dota enthusiast ,I love watching and reading techno-thrillers and science fictions. I dont wanna bore you with my education history . I worked for couple of years in India before I set out for Vancouver.

Network Security is always interesting to me whatsoever and I am still picking up computer networks. Wanna work with some challenging stuff that could impact people life some way or other.
