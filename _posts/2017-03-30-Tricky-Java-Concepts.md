 Now that i have acclimatized, I have started my job hunt as Java developer. It's been a while since i attended interviews and even my last job was based on my Internship. Last couple of days i have been refreshing my core java and I want to jolt down some of the tricky concepts so that it might be useful to me or others in future.


I will organize them based on following topics 

1. Collections 
2. Immutablility 
3. String
4. Object Reference 
5. Method overloading 
6. Method overriding 
7. Constructor overloading 
8. Constructor chaining 
9. this vs super 
10. Exceptions 
11. Finalize 
12. Compile time constants 
13. Final keyword
14. Concurreny package
15. MulthiThreading 
16. equals & hashcode
17. Liveness & safety failures ( volation & atomic)
18. Abstract & Interface
19. Weak & Soft Reference
20. Exception in finalizer
21. Copy Constructors vs Cloning
22. Serialization 
23. Blank final vs Blank static final
24. Interfacing extending multiple interface
25. Types of nested classes static, non-static , Annonymous & Local classes
26. Variable Arguments
27. Enum as Singleton
