Not many wants to come back to India after you believed to have settled down. I have decided to unsettle the dust, moved back to India recently 4 weeks ago. Decision to leave a good job and move to India was fueled by a personal reason. Now that i have acclimatized, I have started my job hunt as Java developer. It's been a while since i attended interviews and even my last job was based on my Internship. 

Interview scenario in India is different and I believe i have to ace my Core Java Concepts and familiarize myself with simple syntax and constructs. Last couple of days i have been refreshing my core java and I want to jolt down some of the tricky concepts so that it might be useful to me or others in future.
